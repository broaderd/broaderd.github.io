        <h2>Hello &#128075;</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Dillon, and I am an alumnus of the School of Physics at Trinity College Dublin. Trinity, 
            founded in 1592, is Ireland's oldest and top-ranked university. The School of Physics recently celebrated 
            its 300th anniversary at the institution. Its most notable alumnus, Ernest Walton, shared the Nobel Prize in 
            Physics in 1951 with John Cockcroft of Cambridge University "for their pioneering work on the transmutation of 
            atomic nuclei by artificially accelerated atomic particles."
        </p>

        <p>
            I recently graduated with a Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Quantum Science and Technology. The program focused on 
            the theoretical and software aspects of quantum technology, offering a unique blend of quantum information science, 
            the physics of quantum hardware, and quantum materials. As far as I know, it is the only program of its kind in Ireland. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Specifically, I completed the following modules:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Introduction to Quantum Science</li>
            <li>Open Quantum Systems</li>
            <li>Physical Implementation of Quantum Technology</li>
            <li>Quantum Computation and Algorithms</li>
            <li>Quantum Material Science</li>
            <li>Special Topics and the Quantum Industry</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            More information on the M.Sc. program can be found <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/courses/postgraduate/courses/quantum-science-and-technology-msc--pgraddip/" target="_blank">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also conducted a 12-week research project in the <a href="https://www.tcd.ie/physics/research/groups/quantum-information-theory-group/" target="_blank"> 
            Quantum Information Theory Group</a> at Trinity. The title of my dissertation was <em>Petz Recovery for Quantum Processes with Memory</em>. 
            My supervisors were <a href="https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Z7VAv60AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Felix Binder</a> and 
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=72p40CcAAAAJ&hl=de" target="_blank">Simon Milz</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Prior to the masters, I completed my undergraduate in Physics at Trinity. This was a standard 4-year physics 
            degree with a strong emphasis on Condensed Matter Physics and Electromagnetism. I undertook a 9-week research 
            project in the <a href="https://www.spincomp.com" target="_blank"> Computational Spintronics Group </a> at Trinity under the supervision of 
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EUXp2J0AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Stefano Sanvito</a>. 
            The title of my dissertation was <em>Calculating the Magnetic Critical Temperature from Experimental Data</em>. 
            In this project, I simulated the effect of disorder on the magnetic critical temperature of an iron lattice.
